You wake up.  What... what did you do last night?  It is a blur of
...code?
  code.  You were coding.  There was a bug you couldn't quite track down, and that goddamn div would not appear.  But it's here now.  It's sitting at the foot of your bed, and it's laughing at you.
  -OH GOD
    Who knew the funny farm would be so much like a sprint?  You can DO this!
  -No, seriously, I attack it.
    It squeaks and begs for mercy.  The world is so much more than code, it says!  I just want to live, freely, like you do!
    -NO ONE IS FREE OF CODE
    -...Well, ok, maybe we can go to the park before you go back into the webpage.
    -I convince it that the World Wide Web is the best place ever.
  -I ask it WTF I was up to yesterday.


...booze?
  The light here is pretty bright.
  -I think I'm in the hospital.
  -I think I've been abducted by aliens.
  -I think I'm going to roll over and go back to sleep.
    Very sensible.

...no, I was definitely juggling marmots.
  juggling marmots.  You pick up your phone.  There are fifteen voicemails.  There is a request for a meeting with the Consul of Nepal.  It doesn't sound like he's happy with you.
  -I go to the meeting anyway!
  -I go find something more challenging to juggle...  Like cobras.
  -I'm just running wild, here.  To the nearest zeppelin!
